Kanaballs was a Japanese learning game originally released in early 2010. It was targeted for iOS 3, and used Cocos2D. This was the first game I had ever written, and I was learning Cocos2D at the time, so there is a _lot_ of ugly code in here, but hopefully it can be of help to someone as a reference of how (not?) to do things.

The code is released under an MIT license.
